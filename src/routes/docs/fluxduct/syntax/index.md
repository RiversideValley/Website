# 💾 Syntax 

### What is this repository?

This repository contains the syntax for Project Fluxduct; the Flux programming language. All of the syntax is entirely defined in [stx.py](https://github.com/Fluxduct/syntax/blob/main/stx.py). This repo also contains files used by the Flux Capacitor - which at the time of writing is not yet released.
